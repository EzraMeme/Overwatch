      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        At Overwatch, our mission is to foster timely, transparent civic dialogue
        on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (PPPR). We believe
        informed communities are resilient communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to anticipate crises before they strike, just like a lighthouse
        warns ships before they reach dangerous rocks â€” enabling governments,
        civil society, and citizens to work together with clarity and purpose.
